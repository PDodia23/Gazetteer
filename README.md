# Gazetteer

This application is envisaged as a “mobile first“ website that will operate equally well on desktop computers. It will provide profiling for all countries through the presentation of demographic, climatic, geographical and other data. 

In order to complete this project the student will require access to a PHP enabled web server. I used XAMPP for this application.
Deployment of the open source Leaflet library will be required to display maps and overlays of your data. 

Languages: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, AJAX, PHP CURL
